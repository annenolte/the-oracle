##Supabase 
  1. Authentication — sign up, sign in, sign out (email/password via Supabase Auth)
  2. Conversations — stores each chat session (who started it, which character, title)
  3. Messages — stores every message sent/received in each conversation
  4. Journal entries — stores bookmarked wisdom from characters

##Vercel
  Hosts the MythosAI React frontend. It auto-deploys from GitHub and serves the UI that users interact with,
  connecting to Render for AI responses and Supabase for auth and data storage.

##Render
  Hosts the MythosAI Python/FastAPI backend. It handles chat requests by forwarding them to the Gemini API and
  provides text-to-speech via ElevenLabs, streaming responses back to the frontend in real time.

##ElevenLabs
  Provides the text-to-speech API that gives each oracle character a unique voice. When a user clicks
  "Listen" on a chat message, the backend sends the text to ElevenLabs and streams back audio matched to that
  character's personality.

##Claude Code
  The AI-powered development tool used to build and maintain MythosAI. It assisted with writing frontend
  and backend code, managing Git history, configuring Supabase integrations, and deploying changes — all through natural
   language conversation in the terminal.
